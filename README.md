## Mapping Women's Health Care Access in the U.S. by Congressional District & Legislator
Research Questions:
<p> What is the state of maternal health care across U.S. counties* (based on doctor access/availability for women and babies)? What is it like across congressional districts, which often include multiple counties? </p>
<p> Which congressional districts (CDs) are providing the most and the least access to this care? What patterns emerge among the CDs? Which counties, states, and congressional districts have the highest and lowest rates of OBGYNs available to their female population? Of OBGYNs per birth? Of pediatricians available to children (per birth)?</p>
<p>Who represents these districts in Congress? What is the best way to visually link these legislators to these potential policy issues?</p>
